# Disaster Recovery

Here is how to setup Disaster Recovery between your Vault Enterprise clusters.

## Requirements

- Vault should be initialised and unsealed.

## Method

Login to a node of the primary cluster.

```shell
ssh {{ disaster_recovery.primary_nodes[0].name }}
```

> Note: you can use any of the nodes from the primary cluster:
> - `disaster_recovery_primary_nodes[0].name`
> - `disaster_recovery_primary_nodes[1].name`
> - `disaster_recovery_primary_nodes[2].name`

Authenicate to Vault:

```shell
vault login
```

Enable DR replication:

```shell
vault write -f sys/replication/dr/primary/enable primary_cluster_addr={{ disaster_recovery.primary_replication_url }}
```

Generate a DR token.

```shell
vault write sys/replication/dr/primary/secondary-token id="{{ disaster_recovery.secondary_token_id }}"
```

This last command will output the token that has to be provided on the secondary in the next step.

Login to a node of the secondary cluster.

```shell
ssh {{ disaster_recovery.secondary_nodes[0].name }}
```

> Note: you can use any of the nodes from the primary cluster:
> - `disaster_recovery.secondary_nodes[0].name`
> - `disaster_recovery.secondary_nodes[1].name`
> - `disaster_recovery.secondary_nodes[2].name`

Authenicate to Vault:

```shell
vault login
```

Enable DR replication:

```shell
vault write sys/replication/dr/secondary/enable token=TOKEN_FROM_PRIMARY primary_api_addr={{ disaster_recovery.primary_api_url }}
```

Generate a DR operation token.

```shell
TODO: fill in.
```
